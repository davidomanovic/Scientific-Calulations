Dictionary learning - machine learning technique that involves retrieving linear basis vectors from a dataset in a matrix. MNIST dataset training

Diffusion weighted MRI - Diffusion and Brownian motions are modeled by implementing Python script. In the code, numerical methods are used to simulate simple one and two dimensional eddies with a simple algorithm. Furthermore, we look at the diffusion of water molecules in the brain. Our simulations should provide the best possible description of diffusion in tissue. Furthermore, simple image analysis is performed on an intensity image that is implemented with the Sobel filter.

Fourier Transform Infrared Spectroscopy - FTIR Experiement and project 

Vapor pressure for H2O - Linear regression, curve fitting, cubic splines, experimental data vs. curvefit, interpolation
